# Progress report - week 3
I implemented the most complex parts of parser this week. While doing that,
it became apparent that some of the existing code required refactoring.
In addition to these main tasks, I've worked on improving documentation and
testing. Code quality is also checked by Checkstyle now.

I plan to work on other parser components, e.g. script-level parser next week.
I'll also get started with writing the interpreter, though it will be unlikely
to be in an usable state that soon.

Less critical tasks include improving parser test coverage and improving
usability of APIs used to register expressions.
