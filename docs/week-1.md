# Progress report - week 1
I wrote initial project definition. It is sufficient to start experimenting
with the implementation, but will probably need some changes later.
Besides that, I set up a basic Gradle project and wrote a tiny part of
Skripty's core API. Nothing finished or really usable yet.
